Tic-Tac-Toe Game: Description
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. The goal of the game is to be the first player to get three of their marks (either "X" or "O") in a row, column, or diagonal. The game alternates between the two players, and the first player to achieve a winning combination or to fill all spaces in the grid wins.

Game Setup:
The board consists of 3 rows and 3 columns, creating a 3x3 grid.
Each player takes turns to place their mark (either "X" or "O") on an empty spot in the grid.
The first player usually takes "X", and the second player takes "O".
How to Win:
A player wins the game if they are able to place three of their marks in a row. This can happen in several ways:

Row: Three consecutive marks in a horizontal line (e.g., top, middle, or bottom row).
Column: Three consecutive marks in a vertical line (e.g., left, center, or right column).
Diagonal: Three consecutive marks in a diagonal line, either from the top-left to bottom-right or from top-right to bottom-left.
Game Rules:
Players alternate turns to place their mark on an empty spot on the grid.
Once a player has placed their mark, the game checks if there is a winner. If so, the game ends.
If all cells in the grid are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw or tie.
The grid is typically represented as a 3x3 matrix, where each cell is either empty (denoted as " ") or filled with either an "X" or an "O".
